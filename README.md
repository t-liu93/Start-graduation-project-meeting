# Start-graduation-project-meeting 
As a intern at Philips Healthcare in Best, also a master student from TU/e working on my graduation project, I was invited to sharing my experiences related to my graduation project. These slides were used during the so-called "start graduation project meeting". During that meeting I gave a presentation to tell some stories about my graduation project. The meeting was held on May 24, 2018

These people extended the sophisticated TU/e beamer library for LaTeX, the repository of the library is at https://github.com/Caster/Beamer-TUe. As a user of this library, I also included the TeX code of the library in my repository. Therefore I kept using GPLv3 license of my repository.
